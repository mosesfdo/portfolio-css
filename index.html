                    <p>TuneGrab is a Python application that allows users to download Spotify tracks and playlists as MP3 files using the Spotify API and yt-dlp. With a sleek, dark-themed GUI, it offers an intuitive way to manage your music collection.</p>

                    <p>All I wanted was a simple app to download songs for free. After trying every sketchy tool on the internet, I gave up and built my own. TuneGrab does exactly what I wanted—no ads, no drama, just music.</p>

            <h2>“And he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding,

            <p class="verse-mark">— Exodus 35:31-32</p>
            <p>I’ve always been curious by nature. While most people around me 
                just used computers, I found myself digging deeper—trying to
                 understand how things worked under the hood. I was constantly 
                 exploring, experimenting, and learning more than my peers. 
                 One thing that always frustrated me? Finding the right software,
                  app, or tool for what I needed. Nothing ever seemed to do exactly
                   what I wanted. That’s when it hit me—‘Why not build my own?’ 
                   A simple idea, maybe even a little wild at the time—but it
                    changed everything. It pushed me to learn how to design and
                     develop products myself. That spark turned into a passion. 
                     Now, I don't just look for solutions

                <p>TuneGrab is a Python application that allows users to download Spotify tracks 
                    and playlists as MP3 files using the Spotify API and yt-dlp. With a sleek, 
                    dark-themed GUI built with CustomTkinter, it offers an intuitive way to search, 
                    download, and manage your music collection.</p>
                <a href="#"><h4>Cause:</h4></a>
                <p>All I wanted was a simple app to download songs for free. After trying every sketchy 
                    tool on the internet and getting nothing but broken links and malware warnings,
                     I gave up... and built my own. TuneGrab does exactly what I wanted—no ads,
                      no drama, just music. Built it out of frustration. Kept it because it works."</p>

        <p class="verse-mark">— Exodus 35:31-32</p>
        <p>I’ve always been curious by nature. While most people around me 
            just used computers, I found myself digging deeper—trying to
             understand how things worked under the hood. I was constantly 
             exploring, experimenting, and learning more than my peers. 
             One thing that always frustrated me? Finding the right software,
              app, or tool for what I needed. Nothing ever seemed to do exactly
               what I wanted. That’s when it hit me—‘Why not build my own?’ 
               A simple idea, maybe even a little wild at the time—but it
                changed everything. It pushed me to learn how to design and
                 develop products myself. That spark turned into a passion. 
                 Now, I don't just look for solutions

                </p>
                <p>—I create them.</p>
